# Petition Project

This is a multi-page application that gathers signatures for a cause (I decided to try and get SPICED Academy to get a kitty petting zooâ€¦ In vain!). Check it out on heroku [here](https://pearlapetition.herokuapp.com). This was my first "big" project, started in my 9th week at SPICED Academy.  

### Features:

- Users must register or login.
- Add their signature on a 2D canvas.
- After signing, users can:
  - Edit their profile (city, age, website)
  - Delete their signature
  - View other signers
  - Filter signers by city

### Technologies Used:

- Handlebars.js for server-side rendering.
- Node.js
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL
